# CSCI350-Grading-Tools
## Hello there

Hello, if you are here because you are a member of the USC CSCI 350 teaching team (Professor, TA, CP), then you are at the right place! Here are the tools I have made to make grading easy.

If you are not a member of the CSCI 350 teaching team (student, or just someone else), then feel free to poke around. I'll just let you know right away that you won't find answers to anything here, so don't waste your time trying.
