3. Pintos Guide: This a guide for the students to help them with the projects. This is NOT an official guide, just something I wrote for fun.

4. Simple Guide to C: For students who have never written in C before, this is a good starting guide for students who are familiar with C++ but not C.

5. Sublime_Tutorial: Sublime is a great text editor for Pintos, especially with its file navigation right from the keyboard. I highly recommend this text editor, especially since it's already installed in the VM environment.
