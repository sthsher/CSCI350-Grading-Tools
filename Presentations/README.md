## Presentation + Piazza

With each presentation I usually post a piazza followup note to direct the students to the necessary resources. You can find the piazza post (without formatting since Piazza doesn't allow markdown formatting to be exported / imported) in this directory also.

For the piazza posts, you'll want to 1) link available documents in Piazza for quick access, and 2) use the code section to format the test lines.

For presentations, of course these presentations were made in my own style. Feel free to create your own presentations using mine as reference. If you are using my presentation, please do go through and update the due dates and links to late day forms etc.
